# Minimal Changes Rule

When implementing features or fixes:

1. **Scope**: Only modify what is necessary to accomplish the task
2. **Avoid refactoring**: Unless explicitly requested, do not refactor adjacent code
3. **Preserve style**: Match existing code patterns and conventions
4. **No gold-plating**: Implement what is asked, not what might be "nice to have"
5. **Document decisions**: If a design decision is made, note it in learnings

## Rationale

- Smaller changes are easier to review
- Reduced risk of unintended side effects
- Faster iteration cycles
- Clearer change attribution
